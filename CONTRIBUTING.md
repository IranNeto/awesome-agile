## New To Github?

This repository consists mostly of markdown documents. Unfamiliar with markdown? Here's a [link](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) to GitHub's cheat sheet for _GitHub Flavored Markdown_, a markdown version that has special syntax for additional features.

You may also want to read some of Github's user documentation on creating a pull request. These guides can be quite helpful for beginners. The ones to start with are [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
